# ConvolutionSignalSystem

The Convolution Signal System project is a simple python based project for the convolution of signal. The project contains different signal generators. The code can be utilised for the learning of the signal and systems course.

The code is editting and will be finished before the end of this semester.

# Structure of the system

The system contains three components:

1 A variety of signal generators.

2 A convolution function. The function will give the formula of the convolution signal.

3 A visualization system.
